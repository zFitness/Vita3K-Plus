# v1.0
- **Killzone** Plays well and looks amazing
- **Resistance** Colours are now all good. Intermittent freezing has been fixed.
- **Assassin's Creed III: Liberation**: Graphical issues fixed
- **LittleBigPlanet**: Missing backgrounds, starting sounds and other graphics fixed
- **Need for Speed: Most Wanted**: floating badges fixed, headlights through the road fixed, sound fixed (mostly).
- **Call of Duty: Declassified** Boots and plays well now
- **Uncharted** Now plays at any resolution plus minor fixes
- **Devious Dungeon** Now launches fine
- **Sonic Transformed** Plays well and looks amazing (new per game thread accuracy setting to ensure a good startup)
- **Spider-Man** No longer sometimes hangs on load.
- **Helldivers** No longer sometimes crashes at startup
- **Soul Sacrifice Delta**: Graphical issues fixed
- **Minecraft** was a white screen in Vulkan, now fixed
- **Kancolle Kai** Now plays without getting stuck at the difficulty selection screen
  
Hopefully a lot of crash bugs and freezing have been fixed by these changes. Other games may now be a lot better or possibly worse with this version.

## Notes

- The settings now default to High Quality
- These updates were designed with higher-end devices in mind. Although I have attempted to make them work and tested on Mali based devices (i.e. Killzone works fine on a Mali-G78 MP14 device I have) that is not the goal of this fork.
- For better character shadows in Killzone use a memory mapping of External Host on Windows or Native Buffer on Android. Double Buffer works well but makes the shadows flicker annonyingly.
