# Vita3K+

English | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

A fork of [Vita3K+](https://github.com/nckstwrt/Vita3K-Plus) maintained by **zFitness (ZM)**, which itself is a fork of Vita3K with additional game compatibility and rendering fixes. The Android builds published here are named **Vita3K+ ZM** on the launcher, where `ZM` is simply the maintainer tag for this branch. All credit for the emulator itself belongs to the Vita3K team, and for the compatibility work to the Vita3K+ author.

## Download

https://github.com/zFitness/Vita3K-Plus/releases

Android nightly APKs are published automatically by [`nightly-android.yml`](./.github/workflows/nightly-android.yml) under tags like `android-nightly-<build>-<sha>`.

## Android notes

> **Snapdragon / Adreno:** Use Turnip drivers for the best compatibility.

> **Mali Users:** There are things that will definitely not work and most likely never work with Mali. Very little I can (or want) to do about that I'm afraid.

> **Freezing or hangs:** Enable **Accurate Thread Scheduling** in Graphics settings.  
> This is needed for games such as *Dead or Alive 5 Plus*, *Sonic*, *Samurai Warriors 3*, etc.

# v1.0
- **Killzone** Plays well and looks amazing
- **Resistance** Colours are now all good. Intermittent freezing has been fixed.
- **Assassin's Creed III: Liberation**: Graphical issues fixed
- **LittleBigPlanet**: Missing backgrounds, starting sounds and other graphics fixed
- **Need for Speed: Most Wanted**: floating badges fixed, headlights through the road fixed, sound fixed (mostly).
- **Call of Duty: Declassified** Boots and plays well now
- **Uncharted** Now plays at any resolution plus minor fixes
- **Devious Dungeon** Now launches fine
- **Sonic Transformed** Plays well and looks amazing (new per game thread accuracy setting to ensure a good startup)
- **Spider-Man** No longer sometimes hangs on load.
- **Helldivers** No longer sometimes crashes at startup
- **Soul Sacrifice Delta**: Graphical issues fixed
- **Minecraft** was a white screen in Vulkan, now fixed
- **Kancolle Kai** Now plays without getting stuck at the difficulty selection screen
  
Hopefully a lot of crash bugs and freezing have been fixed by these changes. Other games may now be a lot better or possibly worse with this version.

## Notes

- The settings now default to High Quality
- These updates were designed with higher-end devices in mind. Although I have attempted to make them work and tested on Mali based devices (i.e. Killzone works fine on a Mali-G78 MP14 device I have) that is not the goal of this fork.
- For better character shadows in Killzone use a memory mapping of External Host on Windows or Native Buffer on Android. Double Buffer works well but makes the shadows flicker annonyingly.
